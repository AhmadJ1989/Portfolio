# 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence & ML, DL, and data analysis Portfolio.  
This repository showcases a collection of practical projects I created during my AI studies, covering:

- Machine Learning  
- Deep Learning (ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Data Analysis & Visualization  

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my technical skills, project structure, problem-solving ability, and my progress as an AI practitioner.
